    "# Data Preparation for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data preparation** is a vital step in the machine learning pipeline. Just as visualization is necessary to understand the relationships in data, proper preparation or **data munging** （数据再加工）is required to ensure machine learning models work optimally. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of data preparation is highly interactive and iterative. A typical process includes at least the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Visualization** of the dataset to understand the relationships and identify possible problems with the data.\n",
    "2. **Data cleaning and transformation** to address the problems identified. It many cases, step 1 is then repeated to verify that the cleaning and transformation had the desired effect. \n",
    "3. **Construction and evaluation of a machine learning models**. Visualization of the results will often lead to understanding of further data preparation that is required; going back to step 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn the following: \n",
    "- Recode character strings to eliminate characters that will not be processed correctly.\n",
    "- Find and treat missing values. \n",
    "- Set correct data type of each column. \n",
    "- Transform categorical features to create categories with more cases and coding likely to be useful in predicting the label. \n",
    "- Apply transformations to numeric features and the label to improve the distribution properties. \n",
    "- Locate and treat duplicate cases. "
