    "## Analyzing Data Distribution\n",
    "A great deal of statistical analysis is based on the way that data values are distributed within the dataset. In this section, we'll explore some statistics that you can use to tell you about the values in a dataset.\n",

    "### Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "The term *measures of central tendency* sounds a bit grand, but really it's just a fancy way of saying that we're interested in knowing where the middle value in our data is. For example, suppose decide to conduct a study into the comparative salaries of people who graduated from the same school. You might record the results like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Mean\n",
    "A common way to define the central value is to use the *mean*, often called the *average*. This is calculated as the sum of the values in the dataset, divided by the number of observations in the dataset. When the dataset consists of the full population, the mean is represented by the Greek symbol ***&mu;*** (*mu*), and the formula is written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\\mu = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}}{N}\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "More commonly, when working with a sample, the mean is represented by ***x&#772;*** (*x-bar*), and the formula is written like this (note the lower case letters used to indicate values from a sample):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of our list of heights, this can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\\bar{x} = \\frac{50000+54000+50000+189000+55000+40000+59000}{7}\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is **71,000**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In technical terminology, ***x&#772;*** is a *statistic* (an estimate based on a sample of data) and ***&mu;*** is a *parameter* (a true value based on the entire population). A lot of the time, the parameters for the full population will be impossible (or at the very least, impractical) to measure; so we use statistics obtained from a representative sample to approximate them. In this case, we can use the sample mean of salary for our selection of surveyed students to try to estimate the actual average salary of all students who graduate from our school.\n",

    "#### Median\n",
    "OK, let's see if we can find another definition for the central value that more closely reflects the expected earning potential of students attending our school. Another measure of central tendancy we can use is the *median*. To calculate the median, we need to sort the values into ascending order and then find the middle-most value. When there are an odd number of observations, you can find the position of the median value using this formula (where *n* is the number of observations):\n",

For example, suppose Rosie tells you she was the highest scoring student among her friends - that doesn't really help us assess how well she scored. She may have scored only a fraction of a point above the second-highest scoring student.
